# AI Development Journal

This file serves as a running journal for AI agents assisting with the Vyora project. It documents past implementations, architecture decisions, current state, and future roadmaps to ensure context is maintained across sessions.

## 🏗 Architecture & Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Dark/Light neutral theme)
- **Database**: MongoDB via Mongoose
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js (Credentials Provider)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## ✅ Completed Implementations
1. **Initial Setup & Authentication**
   - Configured Next.js project with NextAuth.
   - Built custom `/login` and `/register` pages.
   - Connected MongoDB and implemented User schema.
2. **Trips CRUD System**
   - Implemented Trip model (`lib/models/Trip.ts`).
   - Created `TripList` and `TripForm` components.
   - Added RESTful API endpoints at `/api/trips` and `/api/trips/[id]`.
3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Fixed a UI bug in `TripForm` where input text was invisible against the background by enforcing `text-black bg-white` explicitly.
4. **Code Organization & Refactoring**
   - Migrated from generic `any` types to strict TypeScript interfaces.
   - Centralized type definitions in `types/index.ts`.
   - Fixed resulting TS compile errors.
5. **Deployment Configuration**
   - Added `vercel.json` to define explicit build and install commands.
   - Project successfully synced with GitHub and ready for Vercel deployment.

## 📝 Current State
- The app successfully builds and runs.
- Authentication works end-to-end.
- Users can create, edit, delete, and view trips.

## 🚀 Future Features & Next Steps
- [ ] Add user-specific data isolation (ensure users only see their own trips).
- [ ] Implement trip sharing features.
- [ ] Add loading states and skeleton UI for a better user experience.
- [ ] Expand the Trip schema to include dates, budgets, or travel companions.
